This directory contains utf generators and sample utf files for kannada
and hindi. Three kinds of files are present here.



1. .txt file. This contains the roman transcription of a 
hindi/kannada text in a format yet explained in the corresponding
newutfgen.pl file.

2. newutfgen.pl, when run with a .txt file as standard input
generates an output file called utf.

3. utf file, which describes a text in UTF (unicode) format.
