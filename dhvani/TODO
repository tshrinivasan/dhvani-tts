Problems, Future Work, and How You can Help
--------------------------------------------

1.  Improving the intelligibility - The current speech is a bit robotic
2.  Consonant-Consonant junctions are currently not  very satisfactory;
    either there are large gaps, or sounds get gobbled up. Some attention
    needs to be paid to this. 
3.  Multiple voices need to be added. A major challenge here is to automate
    the process of going from recording to setting up the database. 
    The main obstacle here is that of automatic segmentation of the recording.
    Work is currently in progress on this front. 
4.  Adding/Fixing the language rules for the existing language modules and improving them
5.  Porting to other OS - Android and Windows support.
6.  Moving the build system to cmake (if cmake is usable with Android).
7.  Code clean up.
8.  Use OS independent libraries / create wrapper functions that abstract each OS (as a part of porting code to other OS).
